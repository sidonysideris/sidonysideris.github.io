This is a series of graphics which I constructed with the PostScript [^1] programming language.
They are all based on a parallelogram with sides in "divina proportione". This basic shape is scaled, translated and rotated and colored to give the final graphic.

A short description of these principles can be found [here](/pdf/folding.pdf).
If you would like to know more about divina proportione and sectio aurae follow this [link](/pdf/divisioD.pdf).
