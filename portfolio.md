In this portfolio I present a series of graphics which I constructed with the PostScript [^1] resp. MetaPost [^2] programming languages.

They are all constructed following the same principles. 
A basic geometric shape or pattern is manipulated using 
affine transformations and homotheties. The resulting shapes are put together and form 
the more complex final design. The constituting parts and the whole design  are well
proportionate since we take care that they respect the classical rule of "sectio aurea".  

There are now six projects: Running - Lines - Kites - Greetings - Random - Folding.
You can access each project by clicking the following icons.
