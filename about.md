On this site I present graphics which I created with the PostScript 
[^1] 
resp. MetaPost [^2] programming languages. 

Plain geometric shapes such as parallelograms, circles, simple patterns 
are scaled, translated or rotated to build more complex designs. It is essential
that relations within and between shapes are respected by these transformations. This is obtained with the classical principle of "sectio aurea".
